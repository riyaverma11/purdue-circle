# Purdue Circle
Hi! Thanks for checking out Purdue Circle. This project was created using **MongoDB, React, Node.js, and Express.js** for CS307: Software Engineering 1 at Purdue University.

Here's a link to our demo: *coming soon*


## Features of our app
### 1. Registering user accounts
- Each user needs to have a valid email and a unique username
- An email **cannot** be associated with two usernames
- A username **cannot** be associated with an invalid (not working) email address
- Each user has some sort of a profile containing a brief bio, a display image, and topics of their interest
- The length of the username is restricted

### 2. Authentication
- Users are able to login using a combination of their email and password
- Passwords are encrypted and **not** stored in plain text

### 3. Editing user profile
- An authenticated (logged-in) user is able to edit their own profile
- Unauthorized edits **are not** permitted (user1 cannot make edits to user2's profile)
